# Videos (or Audios) Duration Calculator
It is my first self-coded work in JavaScript (ES5).

### How It Works?
It works in the client console. It gets minutes and seconds with a space between them as the duration of the video or audio. Then it repeats over and over until you enter "exit." After that, it is all calculated and gives the answer in the console as the number of hours, as well as minutes.
