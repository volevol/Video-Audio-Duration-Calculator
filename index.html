        <h1>Video Audio Duration Calculator</h1>
        <p>It is my first self-coded work in JavaScript (ES5).</p>

        <h2>How It Works?</h2>
        <p>
            It works in the client console. It gets minutes and seconds with a
            space between them as the duration of the video or audio. Then it
            repeats over and over until you enter "exit." After that, it is all
            calculated and gives the answer in the console as the number of
            hours, as well as minutes.
